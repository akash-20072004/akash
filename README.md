Aim: This solidity program is to demontstrate the use of revert(),assert() and require() statements.
Description:This is a solidity program where we are using pragma 0.8.0 solidity.It uses built in overflow and underflow checks making assert() and require() particularly useful for additional security checks.
we have used the require() statment in deposit and withdraw function to validate input conditions.
we have used the assert() statement  in the resetbalance function to check consitions that shouod never fail.
we used in the transfer function to explicitly revert the transaction if the transfer amount exceeds the balance.
Getting Started:
Executing program:
We can use a gitpod or any local machine to run this code
we will create a new folder on gitpod.
Then we will create a new file on gitpod and then write our code.
we will have to save the file with a .sol extension because we are using solidity programming.
we will click the run and debug option in the left hand side ribbon to run our code.
Thus our code will be succesfully executed.
